### How to make callbacks survive hot code pushes in meteor?

The challenge:

Change this code so that when you:

1. Click the button
2. Force a hot code push (save a random file in the project)
3. Click yes on the dialog
4. << you should see a alert dialog >>

See the global-reactivity branch for IMO the best way to do it.
